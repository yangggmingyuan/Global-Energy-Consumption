# global enenrgy consumptionðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

## overview:

This project analyzes the global energy consumption dataset to drive the insights about relationships between year,country and other factors influencing energy consumption. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, this analysis leverages libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization

The analysis is presented in the  [Global Energy Analysis.ipynb](Global_Energy_Consumption.ipynb)notebook, where you can follow along with the code and explore the visualizations.

## DatasetðŸ“‚:
The dataset used for this analysis is **Global_Energy_Consumption.csv**, which contains comperhensive insights into energy usage across different countries and sectors over the past two decades.It includs the information about:

* Country name (e.g., USA, China, India)
* Year (2000-2024)
* (Total Energy Consumption (TWh)) Total energy consumption in terawatt-hours
* (Per Capita Energy Use (kWh)) Energy consumption per person
* (Renewable Energy Share (%)) Percentage of renewable energy used
* (Fossil Fuel Dependency (%)) Percentage of fossil fuel usage
* (Industrial Energy Use (%)) Energy consumption by industries
* (Household Energy Use (%)) Energy consumption by households
* (Carbon Emissions (Million Tons)) Carbon emissions generated
* (Energy Price Index (USD/kWh))Average energy price index

## key insightsðŸ”‘:
