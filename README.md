# global enenrgy consumption📊📈

## overview:

This project analyzes the global energy consumption dataset to drive the insights about relationships between year,country and other factors influencing energy consumption. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, this analysis leverages libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization

The analysis is presented in the  [Global Energy Analysis.ipynb](Global_Energy_Consumption.ipynb)notebook, where you can follow along with the code and explore the visualizations.

## Dataset📂:
The dataset used for this analysis is **Global_Energy_Consumption.csv**, which contains comperhensive insights into energy usage across different countries and sectors over the past two decades.It includs the information about:

* Country name (e.g., USA, China, India)
* Year (2000-2024)
* (Total Energy Consumption (TWh)) Total energy consumption in terawatt-hours
* (Per Capita Energy Use (kWh)) Energy consumption per person
* (Renewable Energy Share (%)) Percentage of renewable energy used
* (Fossil Fuel Dependency (%)) Percentage of fossil fuel usage
* (Industrial Energy Use (%)) Energy consumption by industries
* (Household Energy Use (%)) Energy consumption by households
* (Carbon Emissions (Million Tons)) Carbon emissions generated
* (Energy Price Index (USD/kWh))Average energy price index

## Key insights🔑:
* 🚀Analyzed the distribution of Total Energy Consumption
* 📈visualized the Top10 countries by Total Energy Consumption
* 🔍Explored the correlations between each numeric features
* 🎮Investigated the total energy consumption trends over the year
* 📈Visulized the total energy consumption by per capital energy consumption
* 🚀Identified the total records by each country.

## Visualizations📈:
* Histogram :Shows the distribution of total energy consumptions.
* Linechart 📉:displays the energy consumption trends over the year.
* Heatmap 🚀:visualizes all numeric features and shows the correlation rate for each.
* KDE plot🧑‍💻:Shows the distribution of total energy consumptions and a line of kernal density estimation(KDE).
* Barchart 📊:Presents the top10 countries by energy consumption , top10 contries energy consumptions by per capital usage and number of records for each contries.

##Technologies Used⚙️:
* 🐍 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* 📓 Jupyter Notebook (The analysis is available in the [Global Energy Analysis.ipynb](Global_Energy_Consumption.ipynb))
